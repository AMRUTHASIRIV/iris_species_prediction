## Iris_Flower_Species_Prediction
This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements.

## Project Goals
- Gain hands-on experience with machine learning
- Implement a Decision Tree model for classification
- Create an interactive Python script for predicting Iris species

## Dataset
-Iris Dataset

## Libraries Used
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Joblib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine 
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Explore and modify the code as needed for your own experiments.

**Note:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn) installed in your Python environment.
